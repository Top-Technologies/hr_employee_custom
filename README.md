Employee Age & Experience

This Odoo 18 module improves the Employees (hr.employee) app by automatically calculating employee age and work experience.

Features

Automatic Age Calculation
Age is calculated from the Date of Birth, shown as a read-only field, and employees under 18 years old cannot be saved.

Joining Date Automation
The Joining Date is automatically set from the employee’s first contract start date and can still be edited manually.

Total Experience Calculation
Total experience is calculated by combining company service and previous experience from the Resume tab, displayed in years and months at the top of the Resume section.

Resume Duration Calculation
Each resume entry automatically shows its duration in years and months, including ongoing positions.
